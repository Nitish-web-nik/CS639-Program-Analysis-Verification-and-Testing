## Program Synthesis using Symbolic Execution

# My 10 testcases are in the folder : assignment_2_231110033\Chiron-Framework\KachuaCore\example

To run the program in Windows x64 based system,

We have to do the following steps:-

Open the zip folder of Assignment_2_231110033

Now, 
## Step i) Open the Code Editor and change directory 

assignment_2_231110033\Chiron-Framework\Submission

## Step ii) Now go to the TERMINAL and run the following code 

       python symbSubmission.py -b optimized1.kw -e '[\"x\",\"y\"]'


# Note: This will by default run the code with testfile3 and testfile4

To run the code for different testfiles you can rename it with testfile2, testfile1 etc on the line of symbSubmission.py line 32 and line 36 respectively

# Also my outputs of all testfiles are in this folder
